                    <p> I'm a high school graduate who is excited to pursue computer science and explore the emerging fields of AI and 
                        data science. I am fortunate to receive offers from some of the best universities in the world and am ready to 
                        go anywhere god takes me. I'm sure there's a lot to explore and everything will happen for good. I'm currently
                        learning web development and hope to learn it well.
